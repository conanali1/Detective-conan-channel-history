    <p><strong>In 2023</strong>, the channel was created by 
      <strong>Ahmed Mohamed Eltaiary</strong> In that time,<br>
       the movie 26 was almost out as a translated version,
       so, he went to find an unoffical translated version<br>
    And he found it! After that he posted it on the channel. Then he started posting art and other side things.</p>

    <img src="conan.jpg" alt="the second logo for the channel it descirbes conan and kaito kid as two competors" height="200" width="250">
    <p><strong>Later in 2024,</strong> The movie 27 was published in the cenima.
       So, the owner went to search for the movie in the cenima version. And he found it!<br>
    later through the year, the owner felt that there are not enough subscribers though he works hard,<br>
     so he decided to schedule for every specific time some uestions so they can have fun!<br>
    then subscribers started increasing from that time!</p>  
    <h2 id="third-channel-logo">The third channel logo</h2>

   <p><strong>From 2024 to 2025,</strong> the owner decided to make competitions and other things
    though there was no enough subscribers<br>
   so the owner decided to think with a different way and he went to different conan groups and started inviting
    them to his group! <br>
   In addition, other than the comptitons he made he started writing cases for them! And thats the history of 
   the <strong>"Detective Conan News"</strong>channel<br>
   and one day we will go through the history of our other channels.<strong>

<p> <strong> In December 1, 2023</strong> I decided to create a movie channel 
  <br> because I thought that if I sent the movies on the main channel (Detective Conan News)<br> 
  the channel posts will be lost. At the beginning of my channel, <br>
  the subscirbers where like between 8 to 10 subscribers, and thats how any channel begins,<br>
  but I kept inviting people till in monday, September 23, 
  2024 the channel started rising at the rate of subscriber a day.<br> 
  But at October 24 it stabled for a while where at that time it got to 65 followers.<br>
  In December 11 it started increasing to get to what we got now which is 93 subscribers!!!

<h2 id="third-channel"> Detective Conan Episodes//حلقات المحقق كونان</h2>

<p><strong>In December 3, 2023</strong>
I decided to make the episodes channel and for the same purpose as the movies channel
<br> which is to avoid the lost of our main channel posts. But I preferred<a href="https://t.me/conanchannelall/239"> 
to ask our subscribers for there opinion </a> 
<br>and 16 out of 17 votes voted yes so according to that I decided to create <br>the episode channel. 
<strong> But don't think that the current channel is the one that I made at that time </strong>.
In December 13, 2023 my channel was blocked by telegram, banned<br>, and deleted.
so I made another channel which is the channel that you can see now. About subscribers growth,
the growth was too slow,<br> though it wasn't the only slow subscriber growth channel,
but it was too slow due to the channel getting banned.

<p><strong>In January 1, 2024 </strong>
I decided to create a story channel for people who like to read stories and/or write them.
At the beginning of the channel, probably after 3-4 days of its creation, 2 people submitted there stories,
but after that the channel never received a story and till now the only 2 stories that where written by the fans are posted there. From that time the channel was left empty without any posts, but later I started posting questions/competitions related to conan, and the first name for the channel was " Stories competitions and others " then it was updated to " stories competitions and other competitions " then it was updated to the current title. while, the subscirbers growth was too slow due to the lack of posts but the channel continued and it still exists till now and has 26 subscribers! <strong><a href="https://t.me/detective_conan_stories" target="_blank">Support us by subscribing now!</a></strong></p>

<p>Shinichi Kudo, a 17-year-old high school student, is a brilliant detective known for his sharp reasoning and observational skills.
He often helps the police with their investigations and has become famous in Japan for solving difficult cases.
One day, while investigating a mysterious case with his childhood friend Ran Mouri,
Shinichi is attacked by members of a secret criminal organization known as the Black Organization.
The members of this organization force him to swallow a mysterious poison, APTX 4869, hoping to kill him.
However, instead of dying, Shinichi's body shrinks, transforming him into a child.
With his physical appearance now that of a 7-year-old, he adopts the alias Conan Edogawa to hide his identity.
He keeps his new identity a secret from everyone, including his friends and family.</p>
<h3>Conan's New Life:</h3>
<p>After his transformation, Conan takes refuge with Ran Mouri, who is unaware of his true identity.
Ran’s father, Kogoro Mouri, is a bumbling private detective, and Conan often helps him solve cases by secretly giving him clues.
Conan uses his sharp skills to solve mysteries while maintaining his cover as a child.
<br>
Conan’s primary goal is to track down the Black Organization and find the antidote to return to his original form.
However, his investigation is complicated by the fact that the organization is powerful, elusive, and dangerous.
